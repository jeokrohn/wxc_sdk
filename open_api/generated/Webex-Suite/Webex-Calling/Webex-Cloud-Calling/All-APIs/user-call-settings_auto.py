        `spark-admin:people_read` or a user auth token with `spark:people_read` scope can be used by a person to read
        their own settings.

        Configure Call Intercept Settings for a Person

        Configures a person's Call Intercept settings.

        The intercept feature gracefully takes a person's phone out of service, while providing callers with
        informative announcements and alternative routing options. Depending on the service configuration, none, some,
        or all incoming calls to the specified person are intercepted. Also depending on the service configuration,
        outgoing calls are intercepted or rerouted to another location.

        This API requires a full or user administrator or location administrator auth token with the
        `spark-admin:people_write` scope.
