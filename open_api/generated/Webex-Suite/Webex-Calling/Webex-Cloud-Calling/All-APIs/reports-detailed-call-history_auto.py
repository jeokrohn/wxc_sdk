    The base URL for these APIs is **analytics.webexapis.com** (or **analytics-
    calling-gov.webexapis.com** for Government), which does not work with the API
    reference's **Try It** feature. If you have any questions or need help please
    contact the Webex Developer Support team at devsupport@webex.com.
    
    
    
    To retrieve Detailed Call History information, you must use a token with the `spark-admin:calling_cdr_read` `scope
    <https://developer.webex.com/docs/integrations#scopes>`_.
    The authenticating user must have the administrator role "Webex Calling Detailed Call History API access" enabled.
    
    Detailed Call History information is available 5 minutes after a call has ended and may be retrieved for up to 48
    hours. For example, if a call ends at 9:46 am, the record for that call can be collected using the API from 9:51
    am, and is available until 9:46 am two days later.
    
    This API is rate-limited to one call every 1 minutes for a given organization ID.
    
    Details on the fields returned from this API and their potential values are available at
    <https://help.webex.com/en-us/article/nmug598/Reports-for-Your-Cloud-Collaboration-Portfolio>. Select the **Report
    templates** tab, and then in the **Webex Calling reports** section see **Calling Detailed Call History Report**.
    
    By default, the calls to analytics.webexapis.com are sent to the closest region's servers. If the region's servers
    host the organization's data, then the data is returned. Otherwise, an HTTP 451 error code response is returned.
    The body of the response in this case contains the end point information where a user can get data for the user's
    organization.
