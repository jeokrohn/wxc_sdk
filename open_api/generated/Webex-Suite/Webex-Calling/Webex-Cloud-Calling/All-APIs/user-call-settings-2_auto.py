        Reset a Person’s Feature Access Configuration to the Organization’s Default Settings

        Reset of a user’s feature access configuration to the organization’s default settings. It ensures that any
        specific feature configurations set by an administrator for an individual user are overridden and replaced
        with the global configuration of the organization. This process helps to maintain consistency in feature
        access across all users, especially when administrators want to ensure that a user is subject to the
        organization's global settings rather than personalized settings.

        The overall feature, managed through the organization's Control Hub, involves the configuration and
        customization of feature access for users. Administrators can tailor these settings to individual users based
        on their roles or needs, but sometimes a global reset to the default configuration is necessary. The reset API
        simplifies this by programmatically resetting a user’s feature access, which can be crucial when managing
        large teams or updating organizational policies that affect user privileges across multiple devices or
        locations.

        .To use this API, an administrator must authenticate with a full, or device administrator auth token. This
        ensures the individual has the necessary privileges to make changes to user configurations. Furthermore, the
        authentication token used must include the `spark-admin:telephony_config_write` scope, which grants the
        required permissions to modify the telephony configuration for the user. This combination of roles and scopes
        ensures that only authorized administrators can reset the feature access configuration.
