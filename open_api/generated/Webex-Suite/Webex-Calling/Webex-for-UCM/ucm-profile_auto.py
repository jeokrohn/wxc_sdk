        List all calling UC Manager Profiles for the organization.

        UC Manager Profiles are applicable if your organization uses Jabber in Team Messaging mode or Calling in Webex
        (Unified CM).

        The UC Manager Profile has an organization-wide default and may be overridden for individual persons, although
        currently only setting at a user level is supported by Webex APIs.

        Retrieving this list requires a full or read-only administrator auth token with a scope of
