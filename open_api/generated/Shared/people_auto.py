    As of January 2024, the Webex APIs have been fully upgraded to support the
    industry-standard [SCIM
    2.0](https://developer.webex.com/docs/api/v1/scim2-user) protocol, which is
    used for user and group management, provisioning, and maintenance. Developers
    are advised to use this API instead of the people API, due to its higher
    performance and readily available connectors. Users created via SCIM should be
    licensed using the /licenses API, even in large quantities, using the new
    [PATCH method](https://developer.webex.com/docs/api/v1/licenses/assign-
    licenses-to-users).
    
    
    
    People are registered users of Webex. Searching and viewing People requires an auth token with a `scope
    <https://developer.webex.com/docs/integrations#scopes>`_ of
    `spark:people_read`.
    Viewing the list of all People in your organization requires an administrator auth token with
    `spark-admin:people_read` scope. Adding, updating, and removing People requires an administrator auth token with
    the `spark-admin:people_write` and `spark-admin:people_read` scope.
    
    A person's call settings are for `Webex Calling` and necessitate Webex Calling licenses.
    
    To learn more about managing people in a room see the `Memberships API

        List people in your organization. For most users, either the `email` or `displayName` parameter is required.
        Admin users can omit these fields and list all users in their organization.

        Response properties associated with a user's presence status, such as `status` or `lastActivity`, will only be
        returned for people within your organization or an organization you manage. Presence information will not be
        returned if the authenticated user has `disabled status sharing

        information for a large set of users will quickly lead to `429` errors and throttling of such requests and is
        therefore discouraged.

        Admin users can include `Webex Calling` (BroadCloud) user details in the response by specifying `callingData`
        parameter as `true`. Admin users can list all users in a location or with a specific phone number. Admin users
        will receive an enriched payload with additional administrative fields like `licenses`,`roles`, `locations`
        etc. These fields are shown when accessing a user via GET /people/{id}, not when doing a GET /people?id=

        Lookup by `email` is only supported for people within the same org or where a partner admin relationship is in
        place.

        Lookup by `roles` is only supported for Admin users for the people within the same org.

        Create a Person

        Create a new user account for a given organization. Only an admin can create a new user account.

        At least one of the following body parameters is required to create a new user: `displayName`, `firstName`,
        `lastName`.

        Currently, users may have only one email address associated with their account. The `emails` parameter is an
        array, which accepts multiple values to allow for future expansion, but currently only one email address will
        be used for the new user.

        Admin users can include `Webex calling` (BroadCloud) user details in the response by specifying `callingData`
        parameter as true. It may happen that the POST request with calling data returns a 400 status, but the person
        was created still. One way to get into this state is if an invalid phone number is assigned to a user. The
        people API aggregates calls to several other microservices, and one may have failed. A best practice is to
        check if the user exists before retrying. This can be done with the user's email address and a GET /people.

        When doing attendee management, append `#attendee` to the `siteUrl` parameter (e.g.
        `mysite.webex.com#attendee`) to make the new user an attendee for a site.

        **NOTES**:

        * For creating a `Webex Calling` user, you must provide `phoneNumbers` or `extension`, `locationId`, and
        `licenses` string in the same request.

        * `SipAddresses` are asigned via an asynchronous process. This means that the POST response may not show the
        SIPAddresses immediately. Instead you can verify them with a separate GET to /people, after they were newly
        configured.

        Update a Person

        Update details for a person, by ID.

        Specify the person ID in the `personId` parameter in the URI. Only an admin can update a person details.

        Include all details for the person. This action expects all user details to be present in the request. A common
        approach is to first `GET the person's details
        <https://developer.webex.com/docs/api/v1/people/get-person-details>`_, make changes, then PUT both the changed and unchanged values.

        Admin users can include `Webex Calling` (BroadCloud) user details in the response by specifying `callingData`
        parameter as true.

        When doing attendee management, to update a user from host role to an attendee for a site append `#attendee` to
        the respective `siteUrl` and remove the meeting host license for this site from the license array.
        To update a person from an attendee role to a host for a site, add the meeting license for this site in the
        meeting array, and remove that site from the `siteurl` parameter.

        To remove the attendee privilege for a user on a meeting site, remove the `sitename#attendee` from the
        `siteUrl`s array. The `showAllTypes` parameter must be set to `true`.

        **NOTE**:

        * The `locationId` can only be set when assigning a calling license to a user. It cannot be changed if a user
        is already an existing calling user.

        * The `extension` field should be used to update the Webex Calling extension for a person. The extension value
        should not include the location routing prefix. The `work_extension` type in the `phoneNumbers` object as seen
        in the response payload of `List People
        <https://developer.webex.com/docs/api/v1/people/list-people>`_ or `Get Person Details
        extension for a person.

        * The People API is a combination of several microservices, each responsible for specific attributes of a
        person. As a result, a PUT request that returns an error response code may still have altered some values of
        the person's data. Therefore, it is recommended to perform a GET request after encountering an error to verify
        the current state of the resource.
