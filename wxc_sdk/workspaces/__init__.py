Workspaces
Workspaces represent where people work, such as conference rooms, meeting spaces, lobbies, and lunch rooms. Devices may
be associated with workspaces.

Viewing the list of workspaces in an organization requires an administrator auth token with
the spark-admin:workspaces_read scope. Adding, updating, or deleting workspaces in an organization requires an
administrator auth token with the spark-admin:workspaces_write scope.

The Workspaces API can also be used by partner administrators acting as administrators of a different organization
than their own. In those cases an orgId value must be supplied, as indicated in the reference documentation for the
relevant endpoints.
