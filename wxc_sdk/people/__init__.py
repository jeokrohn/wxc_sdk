People types and API

    **As of January 2024, the Webex APIs have been fully upgraded to support the
    industry-standard** :class:`SCIM2.0 <wxc_sdk.scim.ScimV2Api>`
    **protocol, which is
    used for user and group management, provisioning, and maintenance. Developers
    are advised to use this API instead of the people API, due to its higher
    performance and readily available connectors. Users created via SCIM can be
    licensed using the /licenses API, even in large quantities, using
    the new** :meth:`PATCH method <wxc_sdk.licenses.LicensesApi.assign_licenses_to_users>`.

    People are registered users of Webex. Searching and viewing People requires an auth token with a
    `scope <https://developer.webex.com/docs/integrations#scopes>`_
    of `spark:people_read`. Viewing the list of all People in your organization requires an administrator auth token
    with `spark-admin:people_read` scope. Adding, updating, and removing People requires an administrator auth token
    with the `spark-admin:people_write` and `spark-admin:people_read` scope.

    A person's call settings are for `Webex Calling` and necessitate Webex Calling licenses.

    To learn more about managing people in a room see the :class:`Memberships API
    <wxc_sdk.memberships.MembershipApi>`. For information about how to allocate Hybrid
    Services licenses to people, see the `Managing Hybrid Services

        lastName.

        Currently, users may have only one email address associated with their account. The emails parameter is an
        array, which accepts multiple values to allow for future expansion, but currently only one email address will
        be used for the new user.

        Admin users can include `Webex calling` (BroadCloud) user details in the response by specifying `callingData`
        parameter as true. It may happen that the POST request with calling data returns a 400 status, but the person
        was created still. One way to get into this state is if an invalid phone number is assigned to a user. The

        check if the user exists before retrying. This can be done with the user's email address and a GET /people.

        When doing attendee management, to make the new user an attendee for a site: append #attendee to the siteUrl

        To update a person from an attendee role to a host for a site, add the meeting license for this site in the
        meeting array, and remove that site from the `siteurl` parameter.

        To remove the attendee privilege for a user on a meeting site, remove the `sitename#attendee` from the
        `siteUrl`s array. The `showAllTypes` parameter must be set to `true`.

        **NOTE**:

        * The `locationId` can only be set when assigning a calling license to a user. It cannot be changed if a user
          is already an existing calling user.

        * The `extension` field should be used to update the Webex Calling extension for a person. The extension value
          should not include the location routing prefix. The `work_extension` type in the `phoneNumbers` object as seen
          in the response payload of `List People
          <https://developer.webex.com/docs/api/v1/people/list-people>`_ or `Get Person Details
          extension for a person.

        * When updating a user with multiple email addresses using a PUT request, ensure that the primary email address
          is listed first in the array. Note that the order of email addresses returned by a GET request is not
          guaranteed..

        * The People API is a combination of several microservices, each responsible for specific attributes of a
          person. As a result, a PUT request that returns an error response code may still have altered some values of
          the person's data. Therefore, it is recommended to perform a GET request after encountering an error to verify
          the current state of the resource.
