            * Both locations must have the same PSTN Provider.

        Plan to a location with Cloud Connected PSTN.

        In order to change the number usage the following is required:

            * The number must be unassigned.
            * Number Usage Type can be set to `NONE` if carrier has the PSTN service `GEOGRAPHIC_NUMBERS`.
            * Number Usage Type can be set to `SERVICE` if carrier has the PSTN service `SERVICE_NUMBERS`.

        Validate or Initiate Move Users Job

        This API allows the user to perform any one of the following operations:

            * When the `validate` attribute is true, this validates the user move from one location to another location.

            * When the `validate` attribute is false, this performs the user move from one location to another location.

        In order to validate or move a user,

            * Maximum of one calling user can be moved at a time.

            * The target location must be a calling location.

            * Only one new extension can be moved to the target location, which is optional. An empty value will
            remove the
              already configured extension. If not provided, the existing extension will be retained to the user.

            * Only one new phone number belonging to the target location can be assigned to the user, which is optional.
              Phone number must follow E.164 format. An empty value will remove the already configured phone number.
              If not
              provided, the existing phone number of the user will be moved to the target location.

        Any errors that occur during initial API request validation will be captured directly in error response with
        appropriate HTTP status code.

            + 1026005 - Request is supported only for single user.

            + 1026017 - Phone number is not in e164 format.
