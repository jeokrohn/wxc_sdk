        desk IP phone, Webex Calling-supported analog devices or third-party endpoints. Preferred answering endpoints

        person's extension (or a virtual line assigned to them) rings on multiple devices. This helps ensure that
        calls are answered on the most convenient or appropriate device for the person.
